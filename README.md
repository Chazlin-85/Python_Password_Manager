# Python_Password_Manager
Do not use this for actual password management, It does not securely save passwords! (It saves them to a file in the same folder.)
Only use for educational purposes! Anyway, here are the steps to use for educational Purposes. 

# Steps for installation
1. Download the Zip File.
2. Unzip the file
3. If you do not already, you will need to download and install Python at: https://www.python.org/downloads/
4. Double-click the .py file to start it.
5. Do as it says. Enjoy!

# But why not use it for actual password saving?
This is because the file is saved in a .txt file.
Here is a video showcasing this issue: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/8gfnrc9081t05u6stq0az/PythonPasswordsVideo.mp4?rlkey=yme6e1kbxumr5hw66afosae3i&st=f77puyv7&dl=0
This is why I no longer use this for passwords, but it is a little project I hope you'd like to see and learn from my mistakes (encrypt it etc.)
